**Description**

This project showcases my skills and understanding of how @media on css works, working with a desktop display view of a minimum width of 1440px while the mobile version's display view has a maximum width of 627px. The project also showcases a proper way of using a grid layout and lists with the cards, as well as:hover pseudo-class on the buttons. All texts in this project used Poppins font with the fall back fonts of Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif.
